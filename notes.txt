📰 Fake News Detection Chatbot (AI + FastAPI + HTML)
----------------------------------------------------

📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project uses an AI model to detect whether a given news article is real or fake.
The user interacts via a chatbot interface. The backend is powered by FastAPI and an
XGBoost model trained with SentenceTransformer embeddings.

👩‍💻 FEATURES:
- AI-powered prediction of real vs fake news
- Clean, interactive chatbot UI (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Feedback system with rating + optional comments
- FastAPI backend integration
- Feedback stored in feedback_log.txt for analysis

🗂 PROJECT STRUCTURE:
.
├── main.py                     → FastAPI backend
├── xgb_model.pkl               → Trained XGBoost model
├── embed_model/               → SentenceTransformer folder (unzipped)
├── static/
│   └── fake_news_detector_chat.html → Chatbot frontend UI
├── feedback_log.txt            → Automatically created when feedback is submitted
├── run_app.bat                 → Batch file to launch backend + open browser
├── README.txt                  → You're reading it

🔧 REQUIREMENTS (only once):
Open CMD or PowerShell and run:

pip install fastapi uvicorn joblib sentence-transformers xgboost

🟢 HOW TO RUN:
1. Double-click `run_app.bat` (auto starts FastAPI + opens chatbot)
2. Enter a news sentence in the chatbot and click Send
3. AI responds with prediction: 🟢 Real News or 🔴 Fake News
4. Submit feedback to help improve model quality

📝 EXAMPLE INPUT:
"NASA confirms life on Mars"

✅ EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
"🔍 AI Prediction: 🔴 Fake News"

📤 FEEDBACK:
After every prediction, you can:
- Rate: ✅ Correct, ❌ Incorrect, 🤔 Unsure
- Optionally add a comment
- Feedback is logged in `feedback_log.txt` with timestamp and input

👩‍🏫 FOR TEACHERS:
This project was built using real AI concepts:
- XGBoost for classification
- SentenceTransformer for text embeddings
- FastAPI for backend communication
- Clean, user-friendly frontend for interaction
- Real-time feedback collection
